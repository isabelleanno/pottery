            At Seize The Clay, we offer two types of classes: beginner and
            intermediate. Beginner class assumes you know nothing about pottery.
            We start with the basics and teach you a bit of pottery history.
            Intermediate class should be taken after beginner class for those
            who want to learn advanced skills or those who already know such
            skills. In both classes, we learn different techniques for making
            various forms, such as a mug and a vase. We also learn about firing
            and glazing techniques.

            Our studio is meant for you! After taking our classes, or if you
            already know what you’re doing, you can sign up and rent a pottery
            wheel and walk in whenever you have free time. Your imagination is
            the limit! For a monthly fee of $120, you have access to a pottery
            wheel and the glaze room as long as we are open. We will fire your
            pieces for you in the kiln.
          </p>
          <p>
            The studio is open from 10 AM-9 PM every day, closed Wednesdays and
            Sundays, as well as national holidays. (Emails will be sent out
            weeks in advance as a reminder of holiday closings.)
